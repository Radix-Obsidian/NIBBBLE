## 🏗️ **Architecture Integration**

### **Database Schema Compatibility**
```sql
-- Commerce tables work with existing user system
shopping_carts.user_id -> auth.users.id
user_inventory.user_id -> auth.users.id
user_shopping_profiles.user_id -> auth.users.id

-- Links to existing recipe system
cart_items.recipe_id -> recipes.id
shopping_activities.recipe_id -> recipes.id

-- Integrates with AI cooking profiles
user_shopping_profiles syncs with ai_cooking_profiles
```

### **Service Layer Integration**
```typescript
// Commerce services use existing patterns
- Same authentication hooks (useAuth)
- Same logging system (@/lib/logger)
- Same database client (supabase)
- Same error handling patterns
- Same UI component library (@/components/ui/*)
```

### **API Integration**
