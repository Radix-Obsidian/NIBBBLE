## Usage Examples

### Creating an AI Cooking Profile
```typescript
const profileData = {
  skillLevel: 3,
  cookingExperienceYears: 1,
  equipmentAvailable: ['oven', 'stovetop', 'microwave'],
  dietaryRestrictions: ['vegetarian'],
  allergies: ['nuts'],
  spiceTolerance: 2,
  cookingGoals: ['healthy_eating', 'skill_development']
};

const profile = await aiCookingService.createOrUpdateAICookingProfile(
  userId, 
  profileData
);
```

### Adapting a Recipe
```typescript
const adaptationRequest = {
  recipeId: 'recipe-123',
  userId: 'user-456',
  adaptationReasons: ['skill_adjustment', 'dietary_modification'],
  targetSkillLevel: 2
};

const adaptedRecipe = await aiCookingService.adaptRecipe(adaptationRequest);
```

### Predicting Cooking Success
```typescript
const prediction = await mlPredictionService.predictCookingSuccess({
  userId: 'user-456',
  recipeId: 'recipe-123',
  cookingContext: {
    timeOfDay: 'evening',
    availableTime: 45,
    stressLevel: 2
  }
});

console.log(`Success probability: ${prediction.successScore * 100}%`);
```

### Smart Recipe Search
```typescript
const searchResults = await aiCookingService.smartSearch({
  userProfile: aiProfile,
  context: {
    timeAvailable: 30,
    mood: 'comfort',
    ingredientsOnHand: ['chicken', 'rice', 'vegetables']
  }
});
```
