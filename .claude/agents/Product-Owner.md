### **Mobile-First Design Patterns**

#### **Touch-Optimized Interactions**
```css
/* Touch-friendly button sizing */
.btn-touch {
  min-height: 44px; /* Apple's recommended touch target */
  min-width: 44px;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  font-size: 16px; /* Prevents zoom on iOS */
}

/* Swipe gestures for recipe browsing */
.recipe-swipe {
  touch-action: pan-x;
  overscroll-behavior-x: contain;
}

/* Kitchen mode - large, clear buttons */
.kitchen-mode .btn-primary {
  min-height: 60px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 600;
  background: #f97316;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(249, 115, 22, 0.3);
}
```

#### **Cooking-Specific UX Patterns**
```typescript
// Kitchen mode interface
const KitchenMode = () => {
  return (
    <div className="kitchen-mode min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
      {/* Large, clear timer */}
      <div className="timer-display text-center py-8">
        <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-orange-500 mb-2">
          15:30
        </div>
        <div className="text-xl text-gray-600">
          Next step: Add salt
        </div>
      </div>
      
      {/* Current step with large text */}
      <div className="current-step bg-white rounded-2xl p-8 mx-4 mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          Step 3: Season the chicken
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts. 
          Use about 1 teaspoon of salt total.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      {/* Large action buttons */}
      <div className="action-buttons px-4 space-y-4">
        <Button size="lg" className="w-full h-16 text-xl">
          ‚úì Step Complete
        </Button>
        <Button size="lg" variant="outline" className="w-full h-16 text-xl">
          ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause Timer
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### **Accessibility & Inclusive Design**

#### **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**
```typescript
// Accessible component example
const AccessibleRecipeCard = ({ recipe }: { recipe: Recipe }) => {
  return (
    <article
      className="recipe-card"
      role="article"
      aria-labelledby={`recipe-title-${recipe.id}`}
      aria-describedby={`recipe-description-${recipe.id}`}
    >
      <img
        src={recipe.imageUrl}
        alt={`${recipe.title} - A delicious recipe with ${recipe.ingredients.length} ingredients`}
        loading="lazy"
        className="w-full h-32 object-cover rounded-xl"
      />
      
      <h3 
        id={`recipe-title-${recipe.id}`}
        className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2"
      >
        {recipe.title}
      </h3>
      
      <p 
        id={`recipe-description-${recipe.id}`}
        className="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4"
      >
        {recipe.description}
      </p>
      
      {/* Screen reader accessible buttons */}
      <div className="flex gap-2">
        <button
          className="btn-primary flex-1"
          aria-label={`Start cooking ${recipe.title}`}
          onClick={() => startCooking(recipe.id)}
        >
          Start Cooking
        </button>
        <button
          className="btn-secondary"
          aria-label={`Save ${recipe.title} to favorites`}
          onClick={() => toggleFavorite(recipe.id)}
        >
          <Heart className="w-4 h-4" />
        </button>
      </div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

### **Performance & Animation Guidelines**

#### **Smooth, Purposeful Animations**
```typescript
// Framer Motion animations that enhance UX
const RecipeCard = ({ recipe }: { recipe: Recipe }) => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" }}
      whileHover={{ 
        y: -4, 
        scale: 1.02,
        transition: { duration: 0.2 }
      }}
      whileTap={{ 
        scale: 0.98,
        transition: { duration: 0.1 }
      }}
      className="recipe-card"
    >
      {/* Content */}
    </motion.div>
  )
}

// Success celebration animation
const SuccessAnimation = () => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }}
      transition={{ 
        type: "spring", 
        stiffness: 300, 
        damping: 20 
      }}
      className="success-celebration"
    >
      <motion.div
        animate={{ 
          rotate: [0, 10, -10, 10, 0],
          scale: [1, 1.1, 1]
        }}
        transition={{ 
          duration: 0.6,
          repeat: 2
        }}
