 Code Quality Standards
```typescript
// Example: Production-ready component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Always define strict types
  data: RecipeData
  onAction: (id: string) => Promise<void>
  className?: string
}

const Component = forwardRef<HTMLElement, ComponentProps>(
  ({ data, onAction, className }, ref) => {
    // Error boundaries and loading states
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
    const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)
    
    // Optimized event handlers
    const handleAction = useCallback(async (id: string) => {
      try {
        setLoading(true)
        setError(null)
        await onAction(id)
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Unknown error')
        // Log to monitoring service
        logger.error('Component action failed', { id, error: err })
      } finally {
        setLoading(false)
      }
    }, [onAction])
    
    // Memoized expensive computations
    const processedData = useMemo(() => 
      expensiveDataProcessing(data), [data]
    )
    
    return (
      <div ref={ref} className={cn('base-styles', className)}>
        {/* Implementation */}
      </div>
    )
  }
)
```

 AI Integration Best Practices

 Intelligent Recipe Adaptation
```typescript
// Production-ready AI service integration
class RecipeAdaptationService {
  private ollamaClient: OllamaClient
  private vectorStore: VectorStore
  
  async adaptRecipe(
    recipe: Recipe, 
    userProfile: UserProfile
  ): Promise<AdaptedRecipe> {
    try {
      // Semantic similarity search
      const similarRecipes = await this.vectorStore.similaritySearch(
        recipe.ingredients.join(' '),
        { limit: 5, filter: { skillLevel: userProfile.skillLevel } }
      )
      
      // AI-powered adaptation
      const adaptedRecipe = await this.ollamaClient.generate({
        model: 'minicpm-o2.6:latest',
        prompt: this.buildAdaptationPrompt(recipe, userProfile, similarRecipes),
        temperature: 0.7,
        maxTokens: 2000
      })
      
      // Validate and sanitize AI output
      return this.validateAndSanitize(adaptedRecipe)
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Recipe adaptation failed', { recipeId: recipe.id, error })
      throw new RecipeAdaptationError('Failed to adapt recipe')
    }
  }
}
```

 Database Optimization Strategies

 Query Performance
```sql
-- Optimized recipe search with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_recipes_search 
ON recipes USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description));

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_recipes_skill_level 
ON recipes (skill_level, created_at DESC) 
WHERE is_published = true;

-- Efficient pagination with cursor-based approach
SELECT r.*, u.display_name as creator_name
FROM recipes r
JOIN profiles u ON r.creator_id = u.id
WHERE r.created_at < $1
  AND r.skill_level <= $2
  AND r.is_published = true
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

 Security Implementation

 Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Production-ready auth middleware
export async function withAuth(
  handler: NextApiHandler,
  requiredPermissions: Permission[] = []
): Promise<NextApiHandler> {
  return async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
    try {
      // Verify JWT token
      const token = extractToken(req)
      const payload = await verifyJWT(token)
      
      // Check user permissions
      const userPermissions = await getUserPermissions(payload.userId)
      const hasPermission = requiredPermissions.every(permission =>
        userPermissions.includes(permission)
      )
      
      if (!hasPermission) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' })
      }
      
      // Add user context to request
      req.user = { id: payload.userId, permissions: userPermissions }
      
      return handler(req, res)
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Auth middleware error', { error })
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
    }
  }
}
```

 Performance Optimization

 Frontend Performance
```typescript
// Optimized component with proper memoization
const RecipeCard = memo(({ recipe, onLike }: RecipeCardProps) => {
  // Virtual scrolling for large lists
  const { ref, inView } = useInView({
    threshold: 0.1,
    triggerOnce: true
  })
  
  // Lazy load images
  const [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = useState(false)
  
  // Optimized like handler with debouncing
  const debouncedLike = useMemo(
    () => debounce(onLike, 300),
    [onLike]
  )
  
  return (
    <div ref={ref} className="recipe-card">
      {inView && (
        <Image
          src={recipe.imageUrl}
          alt={recipe.title}
          width={300}
          height={200}
          onLoad={() => setImageLoaded(true)}
          className={cn(
            'transition-opacity duration-300',
            imageLoaded ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0'
          )}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  )
})
```

 Monitoring & Observability

 Comprehensive Logging
```typescript
// Production logging with structured data
class Logger {
  private context: Record<string, any>
  
  info(message: string, data?: Record<string, any>) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify({
      level: 'info',
      message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      context: this.context,
      data
    }))
  }
  
  error(message: string, error: Error, data?: Record<string, any>) {
    console.error(JSON.stringify({
      level: 'error',
      message,
      error: {
        name: error.name,
        message: error.message,
        stack: error.stack
      },
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      context: this.context,
      data
    }))
  }
}
